# interact-python
programming assignments for:

"Interactive programming in Python" a course on coursera.org

The projects are intended to be written in codeskulptor.org, a
web framework designed to help teach python programming concepts.

However, I plan on translating them to python2.7 and using Tkinter 
when graphic display is called for.
